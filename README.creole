== Haskeroids: A simple game project in Haskell and OpenGL

Haskeroids is a game project imitating the classic Asteroids game, written in
Haskell. I'm writing it in order to learn more about Haskell, especially in
game programming context, and the code will be accompanied by a series of
write-ups that detail my experiences in a sort of tutorial format.
